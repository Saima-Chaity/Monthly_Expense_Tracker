# Monthly_Expense_Tracker

While I was learning Ajax, I thought of doing some project work to implement my knowledge. Finally, I designed and developed an expense recorder application which keeps record of all expenses and provides total cost for each month. I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, and Ajax for my work.  

When any month is clicked, it will show result for that particular month-

Result for clicked month, also with an option for adding more data to that particular month and if try for another month is clicked, it will show the list of months again -
